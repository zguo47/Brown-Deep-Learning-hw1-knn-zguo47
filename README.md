This is an implementation on the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithum, and applied to 
the MNIST and CIFAR datasets. The preprocess.py preprocess the MNIST and CIFAR
data, and the KNN_Model.py initiate the KNN_Model, gets the predictions and 
accuracy of the predictions. 

MNIST Model accuracy: 0.9148
CIFAR Model accuracy: 0.232
Resnet Model accuracy: 0.612
